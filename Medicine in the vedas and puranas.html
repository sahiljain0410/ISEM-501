<p><b>Medicine in the Vedas and Puranas</b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">References to medicine are found in the earliest texts including the Vedas. The legendary version of the origin of the Ayurvedic system is that Brahma reminded it to Prajapati, who handed it down to Atreya Punarvasu etc. In the Rig Veda there are reference to the first divine physician Rudra and of how the Aswini Kumaras cured Chyavana of senility. There are number of Riks addressed to Marut, Vayu etc, in which the reference to medicine is unmistakable. Although such references are found in the Rig Veda, as systematic and comprehensive treatment of medicine is to be found only in the Atharva Veda. The Atharva Veda is considered to have originated later than the Rig Veda, and contains a description of diseases and the cure of them. As an example, we might cite the ancient view of the disease consumption. It was characterized as a disease of not one organ but of several organs, heart, lungs, spleen, intestines, rectum, even of the bones and marrow. This surprisingly modern view appears in the form of a prayer – the form in which medical instruction appear in Vedic literature. An even greater degree of anatomical and other knowledge is displayed in certain Upanishads – particularly in the Yogapanishads, which of course belong to a later period than the Vedas.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The tradition of medical knowledge is further carried during the period of the puranas. References to drugs, diseases and health care are to be found in the epics. Thus we see in the Ramayana, that expert physicians attended on kings and they were capable of preserving dead bodies. In the Mahabharatha there are references to surgeons attending on the wounded and the
disabled with all the appliances and equipments in the battle field.</p><hr>

<p style="text-lign:justify">Side by side with the systematic development of medicines in ancient India, there was also organized medical help in the form of hospitals and dispensaries, and a certain measure of health propaganda. During the Buddhist period, monks travelled all over the country not only preaching religion and philosophy and dispelling ignorance, but also alleviating human suffering King Asoka and his edicts are famous. But even before Asoka’s time evidence of organized medical care was seen in Caraka Samhita. Vivid descriptions are found about the location, building, personnel and amenities of hospital-Aturalaya, a maternity home, Sutikargriha, a nursery-sisugriha and a pharmacy.</p><hr>

<p style="text-align:center"><b><i>It should be remembered that Ayurveda is not the science of health. Healthful living, prevention of disease, personal and social hygiene all come under its ambit, and not merely the cure of diseases.</i></b></p><hr>

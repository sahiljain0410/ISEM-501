<p style="text-align:justify">As I started reading about Ayurveda, I realized there was overwhelming amount of information available online which could confuse anyone not aquainteed with the subject. During my research about the reading material, I came across a journal paper, which I think, every budding <i>vaidya</i> should read. It gives a brief introduction to all three important texts (as it will be discussed), explains why one should read it and why Ayurveda has passed the test of time. Since it is an open source research paper, I would love to include it here for my fellow colleagues who share the same aspiration. The paper is divided in different sections and can be navigated with the following links. It is suggested that the order must be followed for complete understanding. (Full paper can be accessed <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3336651/">here.</a>)</p><hr>

<p><b>Beginnings of Systematic Development</b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">We shall next consider the period when systematic development can be said to have taken place. This era is associated with a few illustrious names, the first of whom is Agnivesa. The Samhita written by him which is classic which has survived to this day has been made available to the world by Caraka, a redactor. Historically it would appear that during Caraka’s time the Agnivesa Samhita has fallen into discuse or partly perished, and Caraka undertook the great task of restoring the work, filing up the gaps and re-writing the parts of the work, which had become obscure. This will be evident from the subscription to each chapter in which the author states that he has redone the chapter (Pratisamakrita). The work has undergone a further revision by one Dridabala: at least the last 17 chapters devoted to Cikitsa and the whole Kalpa and Siddhi stanas have been re-written by Dridabala as stated in the colophon of each chapter.</p>

<p><b><i>Charaka Samhita</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is not known when Agnivesa lived. The book is written partly in verse and partly in prose and the language bears a resemblance to that of the Brahmanas. The text is the record of teaching by Atreya Punarvasu to his students and Agnivesa was one of them. Caraka is believed to have flourished in the sixth century B.C. There is a Hindu tradition that Caraka and author of Mahabhasya on vyakarana patanjali, are one and the same person. Many commentators, Vijnana Bhiksu, sivadasa and Bhavamisra, the author of the Bhavaprakasa, to name a few, suibscribe to this opinion. The student of early Sanskrit literature is often confronted with some confusion in the identity of names owing to their imprecise use by commentators. It has to be admitted that there is some uncertainty about the identity of Caraka.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">This however does not in any manner, detract from the greatness of Caraka Samhita. The popularity of the work continues to this day. No Ayurvedic physician of any repute would admit that he has not studied Caraka. The work is a complete compendium of medical information, dealing with medical aspects, as etiology, symptomatology, treatment and medical care in health and in disease.
</p>

<p><b><i>Susruta Samhita</i></b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Equal in importance to the Caraka Samhita is another treatise called Susruta Samhita. This work deals with surgical diseases, and diseases of the special organs such as the eye, ear etc. Just as by tradition Caraka Samhita is ascribed to Atreya Punarvasu. Susruta Samhita is ascribed to Dhanvantari Susruta has recorded the precepts of this puranic personage Dhanvantari, just as Agnivesa has recorded those of Atreya Punarvasu. The Dhanvantari of puranas is said to be one of the avatars of Vishnu. A historical personage by name Divodasa is also known as Dhanvantari, being an incarnation of Dhanvantari of Puranas. It is more likely that the name of Dhanvantari was given to Divodasa of Kasi who was a celebrated physician Susruta Samhita like the Samhita of Agnivesa, has undergone recensions. It is generally believed that the famous rasarcharya, Nagarjuna, re-edited the book and that the Utterasthana, the last portion of the book, was completely written by him. This theory is based on Dalhana’s statement in his commentary that Nagarjuna re-edited (Pratisamskarna). There is also an ambiguous reference from wich some critics have inferred that originally Susruta samhita consisted of only five cantos, and the sixth is a later addition.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">While enumerating the contents of the chapters and the cantos. Susruta mentions only 120 chapters in 5 cantos. There is no reason why he should have restricted himself to these numbers if the work really consisted of 180 chapters in 6 cantos. The 66 chapters in Uttarasthana are therefore evidently later additions by another author just as the last 17 chapters of Caraka samhita are additions by Dridhabala. The work was intended to be a inclusion of medical diseases would appear to be inconsistent with this purpose. It is true that in ancient systems of medicine, surgical and medical diseases were not divided into water-tight compartments, as they are found today. All the same, there was some specialization; Caraka remarks in many places; “Hereafter, hand the patient over to the Surgeons”. It is therefore quite possible that the sixth canto, which deals mainly with medical diseases and diseases of the eye, was not the work of Susruta, but was added to the Samhita by Nagarjuna.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The age of Susruta is not known. It is generally believed that Susruta lived sometime around 600 B.C. Susruta Samhita could have undergone several revisions, the last of which was attributed to Nagarjuna Rajatarangini places him in the 3rd century B.C. The identity of Nagarjuna is also shrouded in antiquity. There appears to have been a number of physicians and alchemists with the name Nagaruna.</p>

<p><b><i>Astanga Samgraha and Astanga Hridaya</i></b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Next in the chronological order appeared another classical work, Vagbhata’s Ashtanga Samgraha. Vaghbeta probably belonged to the second century A.D. He has summarized both Caraka and Susruta and brought both medical and surgical diseases within the compass of a single treatise. Vagbheta follows the tradition of using both prose and verse, though there is more of verse than the prose in his work. From the stand point of analytical classification arrangement and exposition he excels other writers. The Astanga samgraha is for this reason more popular than other works among students and practitioners in the South. Vagbheta can claim to be the first author to have begun the syncretic school of bringing together information on all the branches of medicines within the ambit of a single work which as others he divided into eight parts (Astanga), and called it as such. The eight parts are general medicines, paediatrics, mental diseases, diseases of special sense organs, surgery, toxicology, gerontology and aphrodisiac. Ayurveda is the only ancient science where care of ole is described.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">There is another important work, similar in the name and content called Astanga Hridaya. It is written entirely in verse and its author also bears the name Vaghbeta. The opinion is held by many that, both Astanga Samgraha and Astanga Hridaya are the work of one and the same person. The method o presentation the classification of the subject under various chapter and even many of the Slokas are so strikingly similar in both works, that this view may be correct. After completing the first work, Samgraha the author must have summarized it in verse form and given it the name Hridaya. There are no tow opinions about the superiority of the book. Astanga Hridaya over most other treatises. Brevity and clarity of expression are the hall murk of this work.</p>

<p><b><i>Bhela Samita</i></b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Among the works of great aniquity must be mentioned the Bhela Samhita. The main point of interest about this work is that is was probably written by a contemporary of Agnivesa. It is modeled on the pattern of Agnivesa Samhita. But it is a similar book than the former. Another book which has been published is Harita Samhita, which is claimed to have been written by one Harita, another contemporary of agnivesa. The claim is incorrect and this Harita probably belongs to later times.</p>


<p><b><i>Other works</i></b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Of lesser caliber than Caraka, susruta and vagbheta, but no less worthy of attention to the student of Ayurvedic medicine are Madhavakara, Cakra data, Sarngadhrara and Bhav misra. Madhavakara (8th Century A.D.) comes first in the chronological order. He has written Nidana which deals with aetiology, diagnosis, pathology ad prognosis of diseases. The work is not original but a compilation from various earlier texts. Its chief virtue is comprehensiveness. Brndamadhava is a treatise on medicine. (Brnda being the real name of the author) which contains a number of Siddha yogas or prescriptions which have been tried and found useful.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Chakrapanidatta is wel-known not only as a brilliant commentator of both Caraka Samhita and portions of Susruta Samhita or Cikitsa Sara samgraha. It is a treatise on treatment which is widely read even to this day. He has also written a book on material medica with the title Dravya Guna Samgraha Cakrapaidatta belongs to the middle of the 11th Century A.D. Cakrasadatta Samhita follows the order of Madhava Nidana and Brndamadava. The Cikitsa sara Samgraha and the Dravya Guna samgraha have been the subject matter of brilliant commentaries by the gifted author Sivadasa Sena, who has clarified many abstruse passages in the texts.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Sarangadhara who flourished in the 11th Century A.D. has also written a Samhita. It contains a number of useful prescriptions and is very popular among practitioners all over the country for its valuable definitions of technical terms, called paribhasa.</p>

<p><b><i>Bhavaprakasa</i></b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Bhavaprakasa, the last and perhaps the best work of the medevial age, is that of Bhavamisra. The period from the 10th to the 16th Century A.D. is singularly unproductive in the literature of Ayurveda. The stagnation is attributed to foreign invasions and internal turmoil. When Bhavamisra resumed the traditions of writing he reviewed the developments of the intervening period and incorporated in his work various new diseases and drugs. He is the first author to refer to the disease, ‘Phirangaroga’ which was evidently the contemporary name of syphilis. The word ‘Phiranga’ denotes Europeans in general and the Portugese in particular, in many of the Indian languages. The term ’Phiranga Roga’ must have come into use to describe syphilis, as the disease is believed to have been brought to India by Europeans. Another new introduction in his work is a chapter on Yakrt Pleehodhara, enlargement of liver and spleen, which is distinct from Yakrt and Pleehodhara Bhavamisra included in his material medica certain drugs of foreign origin, for example, Chop Cheeni, (Madhusnuhi) the root imported from China which is indicated in “Phiranga Roga”. He also mentions opium (ahiphena) and the method of its preparation, as also camphor from China and Parasika Yavani from Persia. He is the first to mention the use of mercurial compounds in the treatment of Phiranga roga.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">One important point that is illustrated by Bhavamisraa is that Ayurvedic medicines was not averse to adopting new theories and ideas and had no hesitation including medicines of other countries in its armoury. The sole criterion for the selection of any drug or method of treatment was its ultimate benefit to the patient. With changes in the environment as new diseases and conditions appear, new remedies are also necessary. Caraka himself has stated that if a truth is to be taken even from an enemy for the good of the patient, the physician should not fight shy of doing so, Bhavamisra is a true exemplar of progress.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The history of medicine in India is not a history of uninterrupted development. The science and art of medicine existed from the vedic period and maintained a steady pace of progress during the early centuries of the Christian era. Thereafter, there was a decline in creative activity but revisions and commentaries of the earlier works continued to appear till about the 10th Century. The period from the 10th Century to the 16th Century there was a great lull till the appearance of Bhavaprakasha. There has been no major contribution to Ayurvedic literature after this new work.</p><hr>
